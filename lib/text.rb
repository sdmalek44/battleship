turn in attempt to hit one of their opponent’s ships. To hit one of your
opponent’s ships, you must enter a letter and a number of where you think
one of their ships is located. Once a shot is called, the opponent calls
out hit or miss. If one of your ships gets hit, it will be indicated by
the letter 'H' on the board. If calling a shot (or trying to hit your
opponent’s ships), a mark 'H' for hit and 'M' for miss will appear at
that spot. This will help you keep track of your hits and misses in your
hunt to find their ships. Once all spots on a ship have been filled with
an 'H', a ship has sunk and the 'H' markings on the board for that ship
will turn to 'X's. The first player to sink all the opponents ships wins.\n"
